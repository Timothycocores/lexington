	<h1>About The Company</h1>
	<div id="about">
<p>Lexignton Goods Co. is a company that specializes in goods to improve the home. The founder and Brewmaster is Timothy Cocores who has been brewing beer actively since 2006. Timothy has travelled to different cities and countries trying local beers to create recipes to brew delicious Saisons. Some of the locations that these influences come from are San Francisco, Brooklyn, Saint Louis, Paris, Roma, the small town in Central Mexico; Aguacalientes and finally deciding on the brewing capitol of the United States, Portland, Oregon. By developing recipes from these different locations we were able to create the Classic Saison and paint it in a different light, making flavors that are delicious and destinctive to a specific region.

<h1>Our Values...</h1>
<div id="our">
<p>Here at Lexington Goods Co., we have strong values. We believe that a beer should be made with love, instead of being mass produced on an assembly line. Each of our beers are made small batch with locally sourced ingridents. We use experimental techniques on our beers, which each beer is tried and tasted by the employees at the company before it leaves our Brew House. We take pride in a product with the belief if we would not drink it then why should you?
</p>

<h1>Why Lexington Goods Co.?</h1>
<div id="why">
<p>We chose the name Lexington Goods Co. based off of our old street we lived on in San Francisco. We started out as a dry goods company but decided we should branch out to cover everything that we love. We love our dry goods equally as much as we love our Saisons that we make. So go ahead and treat yourself, live alittle!</p>
